Everyone has their favorite pizza toppings.
In this game, you will try to guess what Anson's favorite pizza topping is.
Can you guess it?

We made a few changes to the original game.
We made the game change from is the user's favorite the same as Anson's to a game to guess what Anson's favorite pizza topping is.
We added an extra step if a user guessed sausage, which asks if it's hot or sweet.
No matter whether the choice, we have the user guess again.
If the user guesses something other than pepperoni or sausage, they have to start over and guess again.
Once the user guesses sausge, the game is over.

Added new variables: guess2, answer2
Added a While Loop for the answers not = pepperoni

***NEW***
I added some Dom manipulation.   I added an addToGuessList function to add to the page the result of the last guess.  I also used document.getElementById to insert an image in the page at a specific point in the game.
